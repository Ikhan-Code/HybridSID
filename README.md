# 🧠 Feature-Based Hybrid Model for Synthetic Identity Detection

> 🚧 This repository is currently under **peer review** and will be made public post-publication.

## 🔍 Overview

This project presents a **feature-based hybrid model** for detecting **Synthetic Identities (SID)** using an ensemble of classifiers. The approach integrates **weighted voting**, **threshold tuning**, and **classifier stacking** across multiple feature types:

- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Transactional patterns
- Network/Relational features

## 🧪 Key Features

- ✅ **Multi-modal feature fusion** from real-world identity datasets
- ✅ **Ensemble model** using classifiers like Random Forest, XGBoost, and MLP
- ✅ **Weighted voting** based on classifier confidence
- ✅ **Threshold tuning** to balance precision-recall trade-offs
- ✅ **Robust metrics** including F1, ROC AUC, PR AUC

## 🗃️ Dataset

The model has been evaluated on a proprietary synthetic identity dataset with severe class imbalance and noisy attributes. For reproducibility, a synthetic version will be released post-publication.


## 📅 Public Release

The full codebase (preprocessing, models, and evaluation scripts) will be made public after the manuscript is accepted.

⏳ **Expected Public Release**: Q3 2025
